# Governance Index

This directory is the canonical Phase 1 governance layer for Praxis, Echelon Foundry's repository operating system. It defines authority, agent conduct, research packaging, engineering quality, and the decisions that established those rules.

## Reading Order and Map

1. [Root agent guide](../../AGENTS.md) — session startup and high-signal rules.
2. [AI Repository Operating System](AI-Repository-Operating-System.md) — constitution, authority, lifecycle, and change control.
3. [Agent Operating Manual](Agent-Operating-Manual.md) — executable research, engineering, escalation, and handoff procedures.
4. Read the task-specific standard: [Engineering Standards](Engineering-Standards.md) and/or [REP Specification](Research-Execution-Package-Specification.md). Executing work also follows the [adaptive telemetry contract](../development-telemetry.md).
5. [Governance Decision Log](Governance-Decision-Log.md) — rationale and revisit triggers for Phase 1 decisions.

Each rule has one authoritative home. The index and `AGENTS.md` summarize and link; the constitution governs cross-domain questions; the manuals govern their named procedures; the decision log explains why but does not override an accepted canonical rule.

## Conflict and Update Policy

Authority descends from explicit user instruction, through applicable safety/legal/platform constraints, canonical governance, accepted domain knowledge, accepted decisions, implementation, local convention, and preference. Full rules are in [the constitution](AI-Repository-Operating-System.md#authority-model). A higher authority never waives applicable safety or legal constraints.

Canonical changes require evidence and impact review, an entry in the decision log, a version/update-date change, repaired cross-links, and a migration or supersession note when behavior or meaning changes. Never rewrite history to conceal a change. Quarterly review is a trigger to inspect, not permission to change without cause.

## New-Agent Entry

Read `AGENTS.md`, follow this reading order only as far as the task requires, inspect current state and applicable domain records, then execute the smallest sufficient workflow. Start the configured upstream-drift clock with `./praxis sync check --start`, repeat the fetch-only check after 30 minutes of elapsed wall time at a safe boundary, and require a fresh, integrated report before final validation (`DF-GOV-014`). If no domain record exists, state that limitation rather than inventing one.

## Phase and Known Gaps

Phase 1 (Governance Foundation) is canonical as of 2026-07-22. The repository contained only the Phase 1 execution prompt and an initial Git placeholder, so there were no domain REPs, registries, architecture standards, Clarity materials, Visual Engineering materials, or legacy governance documents to reconcile. Phase 2 should establish the repository information architecture and create registries only alongside real records, including their schemas, ownership, and validation.
